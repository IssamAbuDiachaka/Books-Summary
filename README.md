## Why This Repo?

Reading is a core part of my personal growth. Starting today (December 29, 2025), I'm committing to:
- Reading consistently.
- Summarizing each book to reinforce learning.
- Sharing publicly for accountability and to help others.

This repo will grow over time — one book at a time!
