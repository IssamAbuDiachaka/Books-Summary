# Summary
- "All I know is that, like
Santiago the shepherd boy, we all need to be aware of our personal
calling. 
- What is a personal calling? It is God’s blessing, it is the path
that God chose for you here on Earth. 
- Whenever we do something that fills us with enthusiasm, we are following our legend. However,
we don’t all have the courage to confront our own dream."

- **The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to getup eight times**
